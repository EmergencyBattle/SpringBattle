                <p><b>What do you mean, online party?</b></p>
                <p>A lot of my friends can't come to me, but pretty much everyone at least has a phone! So what I'm going to do is that I'm going to be streaming from home, and I've picked out online party games that people can participate in, even if they don't have the game themselves!</p>
                <p>I will be streaming on Picarto.TV, on my channel here. (ADD LINK!!!!!) You do not need an account to watch or participate in the chat.</p>
                <p><b>How do I participate?</b></p>
                <p>At this point in time I have two games planned: <b>Monster Prom</b> and <b>The Jackbox Party Pack 3</b>. You can participate in the Jackbox games without doing anything special, all you need is to access a website through a device of your choice. Don't worry, I will explain how to more properly when it's time to play. For Monster Prom, if anyone has the game and want to try out the multiplayer mode, then hey, please tell me and we can do that! If not, there's another option. Either people can participate by telling me what to press through the chat, or if some people want to join me in a voice chat on Discord, we can talk through a channel on my server! (You'd have to be okay with your voice being on stream for that, though!) You can join my server here, even if you don't want to be in voice chat for the stream.</p>
                <p><b>Hey, I have a suggestion!</b></p>
                <p>Do you know of something that might be fun to do besides the two games I have listed? Cool, send me a suggestion!</p>
                <p><b>How do I contact you?</b></p>
                <p>If you have questions or suggestions you can send me an email to emilia@emergencybattle.zone, @ me on Discord or on Mastodon, find EmergencyBattle on Wire or if you know my phone number already, send me a text. I would like to stress that while I still have accounts on other social media then the ones listed here, I am no longer active on them and might miss your question if I don't get a notification, so maybe don't use those.</p>
                <p><b>I hope to see you soon! :D</b></p>
